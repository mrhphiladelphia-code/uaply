# UAply

A job-swiping app: swipe right to save a job and start an application, swipe left to pass.

There are three separate instances, each on its own branch:

| Instance | Branch | Local address | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Prod** | `main` | http://localhost:8765 | The original app (`prod/index.html`). Only the owner changes it. |
| **Dev** | `dev` | http://localhost:8767 | The near-final version. |
| **Sandbox** | `sandbox` | http://localhost:8766 | Every experiment, each switchable on or off. |

Sandbox and dev are the production page plus experiments from `shared/`. They read a copy of `prod/index.html` and
patch it in memory, so prod is never edited by them.

## Run it on your computer

Needs Python 3 and Node.

```bash
python serve.py 8765 prod
python serve.py 8766 sandbox --api
python serve.py 8767 dev --api
```

`--api` turns on the back end: real job postings from public employer feeds (`jobs_api.py`) and application delivery
(`uaply_api.py`). By default applications go to a simulated inbox at `/outbox` and nothing leaves your computer.

To email real recruiters, copy `uaply-config.example.json` to `uaply-config.json` and add your own mail login. That file
and the `data/` folder are ignored by git and must never be committed.

## Make a change from a link (no setup)

Open one of these, sign in to GitHub, edit the files in the browser, and commit. If you are not a collaborator, GitHub
copies the project to your account and sends your change to the owner as a pull request.

- Edit the sandbox: https://github.dev/saifsiddiqueep-sketch/uaply/tree/sandbox
- Edit dev: https://github.dev/saifsiddiqueep-sketch/uaply/tree/dev

The browser editor cannot run the app or the checks. The pull request runs the checks for you, and the hosted page
updates once the owner merges.

## Making a change on your computer

1. Branch from `sandbox` (for example `git checkout -b my-idea sandbox`), or fork the repository.
2. Edit the files in `shared/` (experiments), `sandbox/` or `dev/` (the two pages), or the Python back end.
3. Run `node check.js`. It checks every file for syntax errors and confirms every experiment still applies.
4. Push and open a pull request into `sandbox`. The same checks run automatically on the pull request.
5. The owner reviews and merges. Changes move up one step at a time: `sandbox`, then `dev`, then `main`.

A push to `sandbox` or `dev` also republishes that hosted page (see below). Nothing is published from `main`.

## Hosted copies

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` publishes `/sandbox/` and `/dev/` on GitHub Pages after each push to those branches.
A static host cannot run the Python back end, so the hosted copies use the example jobs only.
Real jobs and application sending need `serve.py --api` running somewhere.

## One-time repository setup (owner)

1. Create an empty repository on GitHub, then:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-NAME/uaply.git
   git push -u origin main dev sandbox
   ```
2. Settings, Pages: set the source to **GitHub Actions**. Then Settings, Environments, `github-pages`: under
   deployment branches allow `main`, `dev` and `sandbox` (by default only `main` may deploy, so a push to dev or
   sandbox would fail before it starts).
3. Settings, Branches: protect `main`, `dev` and `sandbox` (require a pull request and a passing "Check the code").
4. Who can change things:
   - **Anyone with the link, by proposal:** make the repository public. Anyone can fork it and open a pull request,
     but only you can merge.
   - **Trusted people, directly:** Settings, Collaborators, invite them. They can push branches and open pull requests.
   - Do not give strangers direct write access. This code can send email and handles applicants' details.


## Sign in with Google (free)

Accounts work with email and password out of the box. To also offer "Continue with Google":

1. In Google Cloud Console, create a project, then APIs and Services, Credentials, Create OAuth client ID, type Web application.
2. Add the redirect URI shown at `/api/auth/providers` (locally `http://localhost:8766/api/auth/google/callback`, on a host `https://your-site/api/auth/google/callback`).
3. Put the client ID and secret under `"google"` in the git-ignored `uaply-config.json` (see `uaply-config.example.json`) and restart.

Without those keys the Google button is hidden. `python tools/mock-google.py` and `python tools/test-google.py` test the whole flow
without a Google account; `node tools/cdp.js tools/ui-sweep.js` walks every screen in a headless browser.
